# More components

If you think something is missing and it satisfies the following criteria:

- Related to search engine optimization
- Is commonly used
- Has (or we suspect it) to have any impact on search engines

Then create an [issue](https://github.com/GuillaumeLeclerc/vue-seo/issues) and we will try to implement it ! 

__important__ : We won't accept every format available on [Schema.org](http://schema.org). It must be supported by at least one search engine.
